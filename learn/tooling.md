## Setup Kickoff

We assume you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm already installed. We require node version 6 or higher be installed to run Kickoff effectively.

## Install Yeoman and the Kickoff Yeoman Generator
The command below will install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and the [Kickoff Yeoman generator](yeoman.html). The Yeoman generator is used to scaffold new projects using Kickoff and to help you while developing to make common tasks much more easier to achieve.

```sh
npm i -g yo generator-kickoff
```


### Once you have got Kickoff, install all the Node dependencies
Kickoff's [package.json](https://github.com/trykickoff/kickoff/blob/master/package.json) contains information for all the project's dependencies

To install them, use your terminal to `cd` into the root of the Kickoff directory, and then run `npm install`. This will install all of the required dependencies to a new folder called `node_modules` inside your project.

#### Troubleshooting
Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running gulp commands, first delete the `/node_modules/` directory generated by `npm`. Then, rerun `npm install`.

## Rock-solid build tasks
Kickoff comes with a number of useful gulp, webpack and other tasks configured for you to use.  These are tasks that you can run in the command line from the root directory of your Kickoff project.

### Tooling config
Tooling config variables allow you to control some of the basic settings of your Kickoff project. They can be found in the [`.kickoff/config.js` file](https://github.com/trykickoff/kickoff/blob/master/.kickoff/config.js). It is especially useful if you want to change the location of the assets directory, see [this post on the subject](https://medium.com/try-kickoff/how-to-painlessly-move-kickoff-s-assets-directory-366543891f93#.tuyaqesce).
